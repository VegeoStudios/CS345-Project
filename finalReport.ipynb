    "For this project, we decided to work on an image classification problem using neural networks to solve multi-label classification. Initially, we began by researching different datasets and deciding on a dataset which was generic (not affiliated with any existing IPs) and contained multi-labels. After this, we loaded the dataset and view its dimensionality."
